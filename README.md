# Sinatra-Example

This project is just a template used to document some of the best practices 
that we have learned while working on a very complex API project. This client 
project had far more moving parts, but a large part of what resonated 
specifically with us was how they designed their sinatra application for 
maintainability and versatility.

The importance in the structure is that the organization lends itself to the 
structure we'll be using in this project.
