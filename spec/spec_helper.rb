# This file was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# Require this file using `require "spec_helper"` to ensure that it is only
# loaded once.

# See http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # Limit the spec run to only specs with the focus metadata. If no specs have
  # the filtering metadata and `run_all_when_everything_filtered = true` then
  # all specs will run.
  #config.filter_run :focus

  # Run all specs when none match the provided filter. This works well in
  # conjunction with `config.filter_run :focus`, as it will run the entire
  # suite when no specs have `:filter` metadata.
  #config.run_all_when_everything_filtered = true

  # Run specs in random order to surface order dependencies. If you find an
  # order dependency and want to debug it, you can fix the order by providing
  # the seed, which is printed after each run.
  #     --seed 1234
